        <h1><em>About Pittsburgh</em></h1>
        <p>
            Pittsburgh (/ˈpɪtsbɜːrɡ/ PITS-burg) is a city in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States, and is the
            county seat of Allegheny County. A population of about 300,286 (2019) residents live within the city limits,
            making it the 66th-largest city in the U.S. and the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania behind
            Philadelphia. The Pittsburgh metropolitan area is the anchor of Western Pennsylvania; its population of
            2,324,743 is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the
            27th-largest in the U.S.

            Pittsburgh is located in the southwest of the state, at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the
            Monongahela River, forming the Ohio River.[4] Pittsburgh is known both as "the Steel City" for its more than
            300 steel-related businesses and as the "City of Bridges" for its 446 bridges.[5] The city features 30
            skyscrapers, two inclined railways, a pre-revolutionary fortification and the Point State Park at the
            confluence of the rivers. The city developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the
            mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains made the area coveted by the French and British empires, Virginians,
            Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[6]

            Aside from steel, Pittsburgh has led in the manufacturing of other important materials — aluminum and glass
            — and in the petroleum industry. Additionally, it is a leader in computing, electronics, and the automotive
            industry.[7] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate
            headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[8] Deindustrialization in the 1970s
            and 80s laid off area blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, and thousands of
            downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out.[9] The
            population dropped from a peak of 675,000 in 1950 to 370,000 in 1990. However, this rich industrial history
            left the area with renowned museums, medical centers,[10] parks, research centers, and a diverse cultural
            district.

        <h1><em>History of Pittsburgh</em></h1>
        <p>
            The history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh
            region, known as "Dionde:gâ'" in the Seneca language.[1] Eventually French and British explorers encountered
            the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio, which leads to
            the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when France and Britain fought for control in the
            1750s. When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi.
            Following American independence in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow. The region saw the
            short-lived Whiskey Rebellion, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The War of 1812 cut
            off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large
            quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the
            largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 railway
            riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that
            summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100
            train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh
            was producing half the nation's steel.

            Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression,
            the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a
            liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the
            center of the "Arsenal of Democracy", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned.
            Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the
            "Renaissance." The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition
            led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate
            headquarters moved out in the 1980s. In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The
            population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of
            European descent and 35% are minorities.

        <p1>The museum consists of 115,000 square feet (10,700 m2) organized into 20 galleries as well as research,
            library, and office space. It holds some 22 million specimens, of which about 10,000 are on view at any
            given time and about 1 million are cataloged in online databases. In 2008 it hosted 386,300 admissions and
            63,000 school group visits. Museum education staff also actively engage in outreach by traveling to schools
            all around western Pennsylvania.The museum gained prominence in 1899 when its scientists unearthed the
            fossils of Diplodocus carnegii.[2]
            Today its dinosaur collection includes the world's largest collection of Jurassic dinosaurs and its
            Dinosaurs in Their Time exhibition oy]]). Notable specimens include one of the world's very few fossils of a
            juvenile Apatosaurus, the world's first specimen of a Tyrannosaurus rex,[3] and a recently identified
            species of oviraptorosaur named Anzu wyliei.[4]Research teams including former Carnegie scientists made
            critical discoveries such as Puijila darwini,
            Castorocauda lutrasimilis, and Hadrocodium wui.</p1>

            The Celebration of Lights was a winter holiday season Christmas lights show in Pittsburgh.[2] Held at
            Hartwood Acres Park from 1991 to 2011, it generated funds for WTAE-TV's "Project Bundle-Up" charity and the
            Salvation Army. The show consisted of a 3.5 mile drive through Hartwood Acres Park.[3]Over the 20 year life
            of the show, it
            generated $3.7 million for charity. In 1991, the 28 displays has 250,000 lights; by 2011 it had grown to
            2,000,000 lights. The Oglebay Winter Festival of Lights is a similar event at Oglebay Park in Wheeling, West
            Virginia. In 2010, a 3-year sponsor, Rite Aid withdrew from sponsorship. In September 2012, Chief Executive
            of
            Allegheny County Rich Fitzgerald announced that he was cancelling the Celebration of Lights due to inability
            to find corporate sponsorship. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette defended the decision in light of public outcry.
            Following the announcement, private citizens began to search for new sponsors.
